            <p>Prompt:<br>Create an Autonomous Network</p>
<p>I am not building anything new for this prompt, but I think similar thoughts to the idea of an Automonous Network inspired my creation of Oasis earlier this summer. I will write about the connections I see.</p>
<p>Oasis is a raspberry pi currently hanging off of a pipe at SFPC in the corner of the work-space room which anyone can SSH into by following the instructions here: <a href="http://mhfowler.github.io/html/oasis_terminal.html">http://mhfowler.github.io/html/oasis_terminal.html</a></p>
<p>Around 20 people signed up and logged in. With just a few initial files and folders suggesting the meaning of the space, visitors continued expanding upon the illusory world presented, adding new folders and files (a window, attic, basement).</p>
<p>Oasis is a strange microcosm of the world — the directories feel like physical space, and through text visitors can have meaningful interactions with eachother, through chatting and sharing files. Oasis attempts to strip down the meaning of a shared reality to the minimal digital tools which can compose it, it uses the bare-bones infrastructure of an operating system to virtualize an emotional space where people can be present together.</p>
<p>Oasis relies on an electric current to power the Pi and a connection to the internet. Once users are SSHed into the Pi, they can communicate directly through the operating system (by leaving files and using ytalk) and no longer depend on any services or tools external to the software installed on the Pi.</p>
<p>In a longer timescale, there are other dependencies which need to be considered (the use of twitter to spread access to the Pi, the industrial infrastructure which was necessary to create the pi, the software tools and libraries which were just to write the software for the pi, and the laptops used by visitors to use SSH).</p>

            <p>In this blog post I plot a roadmap of how to remove my dependence from Google and from my iPhone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just No Google</li>
<li>No Google / No Phone</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Just-No-Google"><a href="#Just-No-Google" class="headerlink" title="Just No Google"></a>Just No Google</h2><ul>
<li>apple maps instead of google maps (or physical maps)</li>
<li>alternatives to Google Search (duckduckgo, dogpile, bing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Gmail and Google Drive are two services I use which I can’t simply replace temporarily.<br>A number of people contact me through my gmail address and I keep some files on Google Drive.<br>For the purpose of this week long experiment I will continue to use Gmail and Google Drive &mdash; if I were more seriously/permanently removing<br>Google from my life I would have to take more permanent steps to remove my dependence on Gmail and Google Drive.</p>
<p>To Permanently Leave Google<br>In addition to creating a new address with a new provider, I would write a script to send an email to all of my contacts on Gmail (and everyone who had ever emailed me) telling them that I was shutting down my Gmail and providing my new email address. I would additionally set-up an auto-reply to send this message to anyone who emails my old Gmail.</p>
<p>To remove my dependence on Google Drive, I would export all of my documents from google drive to my computer. In researching how to do this I discovered Google Takeout (<a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout" target="_blank" rel="external">https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout</a>), a service provided by google to download all of your data.</p>
<h2 id="No-Google-No-Phone"><a href="#No-Google-No-Phone" class="headerlink" title="No Google / No Phone"></a>No Google / No Phone</h2><p>Recently I put a utility shelf in the corner of my apartment. I took all of the things in my apartment which I did not need, and I put them on the shelf. The things were still there if I really needed them, but I felt lighter and more focused.</p>
<p>I would like to treat my phone like my apartment &mdash; instead of the maximalist cultural notion of having access to as many things as possible, I want to only have access to the things I need and keep everything else on a utility shelf (a laptop or desktop).</p>

<p>——————– dream phone (speculative design)<br>…. make &amp; receive phone calls<br>…. google maps<br>…. instapaper<br>…. simplenote<br>——————– auto text response saying I am currently off the grid<br>…. how to forward text messages to a format which python can read them? <a href="https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/sms-relay-configuration-fix/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/sms-relay-configuration-fix/</a></p>
<p>…. there appears to be no way to do this :/ …. ah, but there is a way!<br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/W7fZt5v.png" target="_blank" rel="external">http://i.imgur.com/W7fZt5v.png</a><br>…..  /Users/maxfowler/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.iChat/<br>… <a href="https://github.com/mhfowler/iphone-autoresponder" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/mhfowler/iphone-autoresponder</a></p>
<p>…. just need to add some applescript which uses python to check the last time auto-response sent a message, so it doesn’t oversend responses…. and test ability of this applescript to forward texts (and transfered files)<br>……. imagining extending this to auto-responders for all services… they send a maximum of 1 message per day</p>
<p>…. it would also be nice if it provided a unified inbox where you could respond and set notification rules / mark stuff as read…..</p>

            <p>An image, captured by the wayback machine from 2009, of a website I made in highschool containing<br>now defunct links to songs I recorded in my family house’s<br>closet (also containing the internet router and cleaning supplies), along with some<br>geometric broken image links from the album art I photo-shopped together from<br>heavily filtered images of things around my house:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090323231502/http://www.maximusfowler.com/maximusproductions/Music.html" target="_blank" rel="external"><br><img style="margin-bottom: 5px" src="http://mhfowler.github.io/notes-from-sfpc/static/remnant.png"></a></p>
<p>My freshman and sophomore years of high school I didn’t have many friends &mdash; I spent a lot of time next to the router<br>making angsty electronic music. I kept a small MIDI keyboard and microphone on a fold-able table in the closet.</p>
<p>I made hundreds of songs, and used iWeb (apple’s WYISWYG website maker) to make a website to ‘publish’<br>the music to. I spent hours photographing my dog,<br>and random plants and photo-shopping the images together into album art.<br>I put all the songs and album<br>art onto <a href="http://maximusfowler.com" target="_blank" rel="external">http://maximusfowler.com</a> and didn’t share the website or music with anyone. </p>
<p>This last spring I looked up maximusfowler.com on the wayback machine and found three entries:<br><img src="http://mhfowler.github.io/notes-from-sfpc/static/wayback.png"></p>
<p>I clicked through to Music.html and found the following remnant of a page from 2009:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090323231502/http://www.maximusfowler.com/maximusproductions/Music.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://web.archive.org/web/20090323231502/http://www.maximusfowler.com/maximusproductions/Music.html</a></p>
<p>Scrolling through the blue letters on the dark background, thinking about echoes<br>of a memory, of looking out the window of my bedroom at night, and an even more distant<br>memory of barefoot stepping on a firecracker and crying, of<br>diving into a lake and passing through an unexpected cold patch of water.</p>
<p>Perhaps these dark blue letters and empty boxes reverberate my childhood to me<br>more deeply than if all the pages of the site remained.</p>

<p>Body and image mediate one another, and the locus of perception is between, and of, the two</p>
<p>‘an ongoing drive to escape flesh’s limitations’ (since descarte and plato)… I argue this escape is pure fantasy.</p>

<p>So I asked him what he was doing.<br>And he said he was trying to find a way to get better feedback from a computer so he would know what was going on inside the computer.<br>And he’d invented this wonderful command.<br>See, in those days they were working with individual commands.<br>And the idea was to discover good commands.<br>And I said, what is the command? And he said, the command is put a pulse to the hooter, put a pulse to the hooter.<br>Now let me translate that.<br>A hooter is an English, in England is a loudspeaker.<br>And by putting a pulse to it, it would just be put a pulse to a hooter.<br>Now what good is this crazy command?<br>Well, the good of this command is that if you’re in a loop you can have this command in that loop<br>and every time it goes around the loop it will put a pulse in and you will hear a frequency equal to<br>how long it takes to go around that loop. And then you can put another one in some bigger loop and so on.<br>And so you’ll hear all of this coming on and you’ll hear this “boo boo boo boo boo boo,”[CS vocalizing in a sing-song fashion]<br>and his concept was that you would soon learn to listen to that and know whether when it got hung up in a loop or something else or what<br>it was doing all this time, which he’d never been able to tell before.<br>That was a great idea, but I don’t think it was really a very good idea.<br>That command seems to have disappeared from the vocabulary. [laughs]</p>
<h3 id="COMPUTING-MACHINERY-AND-INTELLIGENCE"><a href="#COMPUTING-MACHINERY-AND-INTELLIGENCE" class="headerlink" title="COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE"></a>COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE</h3><p>By A. M. Turing (an excerpt)</p>
<p>The short answer to this argument is that although it is established that there are<br>limitations to the Powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without<br>any sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect. But I do not<br>think this view can be dismissed quite so lightly. Whenever one of these machines<br>is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that<br>this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this<br>feeling illusory? It is no doubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much<br>importance should be attached to it. We too often give wrong answers to questions<br>ourselves to be justified in being very pleased at such evidence of fallibility on the<br>part of the machines. Further, our superiority can only be felt on such an occasion<br>in relation to the one machine over which we have scored our petty triumph. There<br>would be no question of triumphing simultaneously over all machines. In short,<br>then, there might be men cleverer than any given machine, but then again there<br>might be other machines cleverer again, and so on</p>
