            <p>An image, captured by the wayback machine from 2009, of a website I made in highschool containing<br>now defunct links to songs I recorded in my family house’s<br>closet (also containing the internet router and cleaning supplies), along with some<br>geometric broken image links from the album art I photo-shopped together from<br>heavily filtered images of things around my house:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090323231502/http://www.maximusfowler.com/maximusproductions/Music.html" target="_blank" rel="external"><br><img style="margin-bottom: 5px" src="/static/remnant.png"></a></p>
<p>My freshman and sophomore years of high school I didn’t have many friends &mdash; I spent a lot of time next to the router<br>making angsty electronic music. I kept a small MIDI keyboard and microphone on a fold-able table in the closet.</p>
<p>I made hundreds of songs, and used iWeb (apple’s WYISWYG website maker) to make a website to ‘publish’<br>the music to. I spent hours photographing my dog,<br>and random plants and photo-shopping the images together into album art.<br>I put all the songs and album<br>art onto <a href="http://maximusfowler.com" target="_blank" rel="external">http://maximusfowler.com</a> and didn’t share the website or music with anyone. </p>
<p>This last spring I looked up maximusfowler.com on the wayback machine and found three entries:<br><img src="/static/wayback.png"></p>
<p>I clicked through to Music.html and found the following remnant of a page from 2009:<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090323231502/http://www.maximusfowler.com/maximusproductions/Music.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://web.archive.org/web/20090323231502/http://www.maximusfowler.com/maximusproductions/Music.html</a></p>
<p>Scrolling through the blue letters on the dark background, thinking about echoes<br>of a memory, of looking out the window of my bedroom at night, and an even more distant<br>memory of barefoot stepping on a firecracker and crying, and other memories, of<br>diving into a lake and passing through an unexpected cold patch of water.</p>
<p>Perhaps these dark blue letters and empty boxes reverberate my childhood to me<br>more deeply than if all the pages of the site remained.</p>

<p>Body and image mediate one another, and the locus of perception is between, and of, the two</p>
<p>‘an ongoing drive to escape flesh’s limitations’ (since descarte and plato)… I argue this escape is pure fantasy.</p>

<p>“It was electrical engineer Claude Shannon who first posited a theory of communication whereby information exists in an immaterial form,<br>and which merely needed a vessel to be transmitted”<br>(A Mathematical Theory Of Communication &mdash; Information Theory)</p>
<hr>
<p>while data might be replicated or sometimes salvaged, embodiment and the material world cannot be replaced</p>
<p>“the challenge for new mediat art and theory .. is to move beyond the twin premises of disembodiment and extension in space that continue to qualify both information and corporeality”</p>
<h3 id="interview-with-claude-shannon"><a href="#interview-with-claude-shannon" class="headerlink" title="interview with claude shannon"></a>interview with claude shannon</h3><p>Claude Shannon:<br>[telling a story about Alan Turing]</p>
<p>So I asked him what he was doing.<br>And he said he was trying to find a way to get better feedback from a computer so he would know what was going on inside the computer.<br>And he’d invented this wonderful command.<br>See, in those days they were working with individual commands.<br>And the idea was to discover good commands.<br>And I said, what is the command? And he said, the command is put a pulse to the hooter, put a pulse to the hooter.<br>Now let me translate that.<br>A hooter is an English, in England is a loudspeaker.<br>And by putting a pulse to it, it would just be put a pulse to a hooter.<br>Now what good is this crazy command?<br>Well, the good of this command is that if you’re in a loop you can have this command in that loop<br>and every time it goes around the loop it will put a pulse in and you will hear a frequency equal to<br>how long it takes to go around that loop. And then you can put another one in some bigger loop and so on.<br>And so you’ll hear all of this coming on and you’ll hear this “boo boo boo boo boo boo,”[CS vocalizing in a sing-song fashion]<br>and his concept was that you would soon learn to listen to that and know whether when it got hung up in a loop or something else or what<br>it was doing all this time, which he’d never been able to tell before.<br>That was a great idea, but I don’t think it was really a very good idea.<br>That command seems to have disappeared from the vocabulary. [laughs]</p>
<h3 id="COMPUTING-MACHINERY-AND-INTELLIGENCE"><a href="#COMPUTING-MACHINERY-AND-INTELLIGENCE" class="headerlink" title="COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE"></a>COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE</h3><p>By A. M. Turing (an excerpt)</p>
<p>The short answer to this argument is that although it is established that there are<br>limitations to the Powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without<br>any sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect. But I do not<br>think this view can be dismissed quite so lightly. Whenever one of these machines<br>is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that<br>this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this<br>feeling illusory? It is no doubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much<br>importance should be attached to it. We too often give wrong answers to questions<br>ourselves to be justified in being very pleased at such evidence of fallibility on the<br>part of the machines. Further, our superiority can only be felt on such an occasion<br>in relation to the one machine over which we have scored our petty triumph. There<br>would be no question of triumphing simultaneously over all machines. In short,<br>then, there might be men cleverer than any given machine, but then again there<br>might be other machines cleverer again, and so on</p>
