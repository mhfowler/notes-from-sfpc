### Notes From "interactive art and embodiment" by Nathaniel Stern

perception is more than meets the eye &mdash; even with what we traditionally think of as vision

Body and image mediate one another, and the locus of perception is between, and of, the two

'an ongoing drive to escape flesh's limitations' (since descarte and plato)... I argue this escape is pure fantasy.

"It was electrical engineer Claude Shannon who first posited a theory of communication whereby information exists in an immaterial form,
and which merely needed a vessel to be transmitted"
(A Mathematical Theory Of Communication &mdash; Information Theory)
********

while data might be replicated or sometimes salvaged, embodiment and the material world cannot be replaced

"the challenge for new mediat art and theory .. is to move beyond the twin premises of disembodiment and extension in space that continue to qualify both information and corporeality"


### interview with claude shannon

Claude Shannon: 
[telling a story about Alan Turing]

So I asked him what he was doing.
And he said he was trying to find a way to get better feedback from a computer so he would know what was going on inside the computer.
And he'd invented this wonderful command.
See, in those days they were working with individual commands.
And the idea was to discover good commands.
And I said, what is the command? And he said, the command is put a pulse to the hooter, put a pulse to the hooter.
Now let me translate that.
A hooter is an English, in England is a loudspeaker.
And by putting a pulse to it, it would just be put a pulse to a hooter.
Now what good is this crazy command?
Well, the good of this command is that if you're in a loop you can have this command in that loop
and every time it goes around the loop it will put a pulse in and you will hear a frequency equal to
how long it takes to go around that loop. And then you can put another one in some bigger loop and so on.
And so you'll hear all of this coming on and you'll hear this "boo boo boo boo boo boo,"[CS vocalizing in a sing-song fashion]
and his concept was that you would soon learn to listen to that and know whether when it got hung up in a loop or something else or what
it was doing all this time, which he'd never been able to tell before.
That was a great idea, but I don't think it was really a very good idea.
That command seems to have disappeared from the vocabulary. [laughs]


### COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE
        
By A. M. Turing (an excerpt)
    
The short answer to this argument is that although it is established that there are
limitations to the Powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without
any sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect. But I do not
think this view can be dismissed quite so lightly. Whenever one of these machines
is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that
this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this
feeling illusory? It is no doubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much
importance should be attached to it. We too often give wrong answers to questions
ourselves to be justified in being very pleased at such evidence of fallibility on the
part of the machines. Further, our superiority can only be felt on such an occasion
in relation to the one machine over which we have scored our petty triumph. There
would be no question of triumphing simultaneously over all machines. In short,
then, there might be men cleverer than any given machine, but then again there
might be other machines cleverer again, and so on
