In this blog post I plot a roadmap of how to remove my dependence from Google and from my iPhone.

- Just No Google
- No Google / No Phone

## Just No Google
- apple maps instead of google maps (or physical maps)
- alternatives to Google Search (duckduckgo, dogpile, bing)

Gmail and Google Drive are two services I use which I can’t simply replace temporarily. 
A number of people contact me through my gmail address and I keep some files on Google Drive. 
For the purpose of this week long experiment I will continue to use Gmail and Google Drive &mdash; if I were more seriously/permanently removing 
Google from my life I would have to take more permanent steps to remove my dependence on Gmail and Google Drive.

To Permanently Leave Google
In addition to creating a new address with a new provider, I would write a script to send an email to all of my contacts on Gmail (and everyone who had ever emailed me) telling them that I was shutting down my Gmail and providing my new email address. I would additionally set-up an auto-reply to send this message to anyone who emails my old Gmail.

To remove my dependence on Google Drive, I would export all of my documents from google drive to my computer. In researching how to do this I discovered Google Takeout (https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout), a service provided by google to download all of your data.

## No Google / No Phone

Recently I put a utility shelf in the corner of my apartment. I took all of the things in my apartment which I did not need, and I put them on the shelf. The things were still there if I really needed them, but I felt lighter and more focused.

I would like to treat my phone like my apartment &mdash; instead of the maximalist cultural notion of having access to as many things as possible, I want to only have access to the things I need and keep everything else on a utility shelf (a laptop or desktop).

…. how to forward text messages to a format which python can read them? https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/sms-relay-configuration-fix/

…. there appears to be no way to do this :/ …. ah, but there is a way!

…. just need to add some applescript which uses python to check the last time auto-response sent a message, so it doesn’t oversend responses…. and test ability of this applescript to forward texts (and transfered files)
……. imagining extending this to auto-responders for all services… they send a maximum of 1 message per day

…. it would also be nice if it provided a unified inbox where you could respond and set notification rules / mark stuff as read…..
